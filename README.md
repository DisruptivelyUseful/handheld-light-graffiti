**Notes about this repository**: We have provided lasercutting .svg files for stencils here, will soon be adding a BOM for the specific build we made, and will be adding info as we gather it. This project is intended to be fully open source, meaning you can use, fork, make and sell with no need to credit us. 

# Handheld Light Graffiti Projector Tutorial

Hi, we are based in Portland, OR and we are here to help you build a handheld light projector from relatively accessible hardware store parts.

Please watch this [tutorial video first](http://www.disruptivelyuseful.org/)

Really all you need is:

- [a fairly powerful LED flashlight](https://www.amazon.com/LED-Tactical-Flashlight-Emergency-Torch/dp/B016449PHY/ref=sr_1_79?dchild=1&keywords=ultrafire+c8+18650+flashlight&qid=1591563889&sr=8-79)
- [a lens](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=projection+television+lens&_sacat=0)
- [a stencil](https://github.com/DisruptivelyUseful/handheld-light-graffiti/tree/master/stencil-svg-files)
- [a way to couple it all](https://www.amazon.com/Fernco-P1056-415-Flexible-Coupling-4-Inch/dp/B000I1AVCS/ref=sr_1_29?crid=25XW03K529JES&dchild=1&keywords=fernco+coupling+1+1%2F2&qid=1591568700&sprefix=fernco%2Caps%2C223&sr=8-29)

The items linked here are the ones we used in the tutorial video, if you want to make that exact build. 

What you are doing in this project, essentially, is sending a flashlight beam farther and more sharply with a lens then it can do on it’s own. Then you are adding a message with the stencil. The coupling is all about finding the focus, the spacing between the flashlight and lens. There could be a thousand ways to do this build and we try to talk about that in this tutorial. We also give you specifics on what has specifically worked for us both in the linked list above, the video, and in the information below. 

Please watch the video for an overview of how things physically fit together.

## Flashlight Tip and Resources:

**FLASHLIGHT TIPS:**

Any light source can work, but LED flashlights are the cheapest, smallest, safest option as they don’t produce a lot of heat that could melt or ignite your stencil.

In this build, we used an “UltraFire C8 1000 lumen ‘tactical’ flashlight”, which we got on Amazon a few years ago for around $20. The brighter the better, but a 1000 lumen rated flashlight with a fresh battery can throw a remarkably large and clear image in reasonable darkness. We have found essentially the same flashlight from a different supplier since then, and link to it at the bottom of this section.

Speaking of batteries, the flashlights that use rechargeable lithium “18650” style batteries are a great option, because 6-8 useable 18650 cells can be recovered from old laptop batteries, and a single 18650 can power one of these flashlights for 4-7 hours. It’s ok if it uses regular batteries too.

It doesn’t matter so much which brand of flashlight you use, but we learned the hard way that some LED flashlights use a parabolic reflector to focus the light, and some use a plastic lens. Both work fine for use as a flashlight, but for use as a projector. The ones with parabolic reflectors work WAY better, because they hold the stencil much further away from the hot LED, and because they don’t complicate the optics. The ones with reflectors look like this:

The head of the flashlight we used fits perfectly into a 1.5” plumbing fitting, designed for ABS pipe, which made coupling it to the lens easy. The closest flashlight to what we used that we could find currently available on Amazon is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/LED-Tactical-Flashlight-Emergency-Torch/dp/B016449PHY/ref=sr_1_79?dchild=1&keywords=ultrafire+c8+18650+flashlight&qid=1591563889&sr=8-79), which appears to be identical but is from a different manufacturer.

- If you have the funds, you can buy a [professional gobo projector](https://www.google.com/search?q=gobo+projector&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS839US839&sxsrf=ALeKk02kNfq3QnQ5u8XuZQiBq0yiBY5QMg:1591572177599&source=lnms&tbm=shop&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPuJ6y7PDpAhUCvZ4KHeW4CuEQ_AUoAXoECAsQAw&biw=1280&bih=596)


## Stencil Tips and Resources:

**STENCIL TIPS:**

This style of projection is called “gobo” projection. “Gobo” stands for “Goes before optics” because putting a stencil between a light and a lens projects a crisp, focused image. A stencil used for projection like this is sometimes referred to as [“a gobo”.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobo_(lighting))

You’ll need to be able to make stencils to throw your own images. We used laser cut 1/16th” black acrylic, cut with a [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/) basic 40W laser cutter, which worked well. If you don’t have access to a laser cutter you can make your own stencils using different materials, like thin plastic, stiff card stock, or even a tin can and an exacto knife.

Cut out stencils work best for larger words and simple phrases. For smaller/more text, we found that laser engraving an image onto CLEAR acrylic and then spray painting the engraved area black before peeling off the protective paper worked surprisingly well, actually. It may be worth playing around with that approach if you DO have access to a laser cutter.

You can also make transparent stencils with a laser/inkjet printer or a sharpie and some transparency sheets. You could also 3D print a stencil, or even just paint an image onto the protective lens that comes with the flashlight. Get creative! and let us know what works well for you!

**SAFETY TIP**: Test your stencil out before-hand and make sure it isn’t getting too hot!

## Lens Tips and Resources:

**LENS TIPS:**

Nearly any lens of any kind will work, but some will work better than others. All lenses have a focal length- the distance from the lens where the image comes into focus. We used a lens from an old big screen TV, because we had a few lying around. They work well, and 3 of them can be found inside any old boxy projection-style TV. (If you are unsure if a TV is the right kind, try gently poking the screen. Is it large, plastic, textured, and a little floppy in the middle? If so, you’re in luck!)

If you take off the screen, it should look something like this. (IMAGE NEEDED) Also note that the Fresnel lens and first surface mirror in big screen TVs can be used to make solar concentrators and other fun optical projects, but that's for a different tutorial. 

Not everyone wants to rip apart a big screen TV, however, and other optics work. Old 35 mm camera lenses can usually be found at thrift stores for $5-15, and they have very high quality optics, and many of the bigger telephoto-style ones will let you make very fine adjustments to the focus and size/throw of your image.

The now-defunct [GuerillaBeam project](https://streettoolbox.fandom.com/wiki/Guerilla_Beam) used a 3D printed slide holder to couple 35MM camera lenses to LED flashlights, which is how we know they work. If you use a camera lens, you’ll have to play around with the spacing between the light, stencil, and lens to find the sweet spot, and then design your coupler accordingly.

**SAFETY TIP**: To be safe, NEVER LEAVE A BIG SCREEN TV LENS OUT IN THE SUN, it can act as a giant magnifying glass and light things on fire when the sun hits it.

**LENS RESOURCES:**

- Search for "projection television lens" on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=projection+television+lens&_sacat=0) to find a similar lens to the one we used in this tutorial for around $10.
- Ask around for old TV lenses and camera lenses
- Check thrift shops and re-stores.

## Coupler Tips and Resources:

**COUPLER TIPS:**

The coupler can be anything that securely holds the flashlight to the lens, and allows you to make small adjustments to the focus. We used a 1.5”x4” rubber FERNCO ABS pipe plumbing fitting, which happened to fit our lens on one end and flashlight on the other, and these should be available at any large hardware store. 

These kinds of fittings come in a wide range of sizes, and are a good, cheap, widely available option for connecting things together. Source your flashlight and lens first, and then find your coupler to match them. The distance between the lens and the stencil is more important than the distance between the light source and the stencil. Find the focal length by simply holding your lens in front of your stencil/flashlight and then source your coupler accordingly.
