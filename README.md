# Handheld Light Graffiti Projector Tutorial

**Intro**

Hi, we are based in Portland, OR and we are here to help you build a handheld light projector from relatively accessable hardware store parts.

Really all you need is:

- a fairly powerful LED flashlight
- a lens
- a stencil
- a way to couple it all

What you are doing is sending the flashlight beam farther and more sharply with the lens. Then you are adding words/images with the stencil. The coupling is all about finding the focus, the spacing between the flashlight and lens. There could be a thousand ways to do this.


## Flashlight Tip and Resources:

**FLASHLIGHT TIPS:**
- use the brightest LED flashlight you can find. 1000+ lumins is best. It should say what lumins it has in the specifications for the product.
- It should have a parabolic mirror, not a convex one.

## Stencil Tips and Resources:

**STENCIL TIPS:**
- Stencils can be low or high tech. Here are a few examples:
- lasercut acrylic (.svg files included in this repo). 

**STENCIL RESOURCES**
- If you do not own a lasercutter you can ask your local makerspace to help, or use a custom online lasercutting service like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/)

SAFETY TIPS:

It is important that your stencil is not in direct contact with the flashlight bulb, LED or not. Test your stencil beforehand to make sure it does not get too hot.
